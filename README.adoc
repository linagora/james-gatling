= Gatling tests for James server

For now, you need to have a running dockerized James JMAP server running on the same computer than your Gatling host. It needs to export the webAdmin over port 8000.

Alternativly you can set up the following system properties:

 * `TARGET_HOSTNAME` which is set to `localhost` by default
 * `SMTP_PORT` which is set to `25` by default
 * `SMTP_SSL_PORT` which is set to `465` by default
 * `JMAP_PORT` which is set to `1080` by default
 * `JMAP_PROTOCOL` which is set to `http` by default (you can use `https` instead for example)
 * `WEBADMIN_PORT` which is set to `8000` by default
 * `WEBADMIN_PROTOCOL` which is set to `http` by default (you can use `https` instead for example)

In some cases you could want to specify target hostname per protocol, the following properties can help you:
 * `SMTP_TARGET_HOSTNAME` which is set to `TARGET_HOSTNAME` by default
 * `JMAP_TARGET_HOSTNAME` which is set to `TARGET_HOSTNAME` by default
 * `IMAP_SERVER_HOSTNAME` which is set to `TARGET_HOSTNAME` by default
 * `WEBADMIN_SERVER_HOSTNAME` which is set to `TARGET_HOSTNAME` by default

You can run all the scenari via sbt :

.bash
----
$ sbt
 > gatling:test

Run a specific scenario via sbt :

.bash
